# AR-Plane-Detection
This is my first AR project built with the Unity Game Engine with Google ARCore.\
You can find the list of ARCore Supported devices here: (https://developers.google.com/ar/devices) \
It is an AR project that detects and overlays a 4-sided Geometry on any horizontal and vertical surface.\
So Yh! That's it. You can find the apk file in the repository.
